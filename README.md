# Personal solutions to exams of S.T.
In preperation for an exam coaching i wrote these solutions for the decision theory part of the official exams from the last 3 exam periods (that is winter term 22/23, 23/24 and summer term 23).

Take these as guides to compare with your own solutions.

_Please note, that these are NOT the official solutions, some exercises may have small mistakes in them._
